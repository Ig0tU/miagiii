## BlackboxAI Integration ##

## Overview
This code integrates the Hugging Face Transformers library into Big-Agi, using only models hosted on the Hugging Face model hub. This will ensure seamless functionality and integration with the Big-Agi platform.

## Files Affected
- bigagi/integrations/blackboxai/__init__.py
- bigagi/integrations/blackboxai/huggingface.py

## Changes

### bigagi/integrations/blackboxai/__init__.py

The `__init__.py` file in the `bigagi/integrations/blackboxai` directory is updated to include the necessary imports and setup for the Hugging Face integration.




### bigagi/integrations/blackboxai/huggingface.py

The `huggingface.py` file in the `bigagi/integrations/blackboxai` directory contains the implementation of the `HuggingFaceModel` class, which provides a simple interface for loading and using models hosted on the Hugging Face model hub.




This implementation provides a simple interface for loading and using models hosted on the Hugging Face model hub, with support for both CPU and GPU inference. The `HuggingFaceModel` class provides two methods: `encode`, which encodes a given text input using the model's tokenizer, and `generate`, which generates a text output given an input tensor.

By using the Hugging Face Transformers library, this implementation ensures seamless functionality and integration with the Big-Agi platform, as well as compatibility with a wide range of pre-trained models.
